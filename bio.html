            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Brenda and I'm a cybersecurity major. I'm not sure yet exactly what I'd like to do professionaly,
            but I'm mainly interested in cyber defense and ethical hacking. I'm also an EMT, so I think working in cybersecurity
            for a healthcare organization would be a cool way to mix the two. I don't have too much time for hobbies or interests, 
            but the ones I do have include music, legos, and minecraft. With music, it was (and still is) a big passion of mine. I started out 
            with multiple instruments including piano, which I still play today (it's been a decade!). I was originally going to 
            major in audio engineering/music production, and was even accepted to Berklee College of Music, but at the last minute 
            changed plans completely. I still do audio engineering for my church's worship team though, and am glad I still have outlets to 
            keep performing. Overall, I'm happy with where I am now and am excited to see where the rest of college takes me!
